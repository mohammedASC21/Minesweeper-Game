# Minesweeper Game (Java)

Welcome to Minesweeper! This is a classic logic-based game built in Java with a graphical user interface. Your goal is to clear the board without clicking on any mines.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Click a tile to reveal what’s underneath.
- Numbers show how many mines are around a tile.
- Use logic to avoid the mines!
- Right-click to flag a tile you think has a mine (if right-click is supported in your version).
- The game ends when all non-mine tiles are revealed — or when you hit a mine.
  

## 📁 Project Structure

- `MineSweeperGUI.java` – Handles the GUI (uses `JFrame`, `JButton`, etc.).
- `Grid.java` – The core game logic and grid generation.
- `Player.java` – Tracks player actions and stats.
- `GameBoardInterface.java` – Interface used by the game board.
